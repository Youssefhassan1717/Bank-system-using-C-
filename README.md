# Bank-system-using-C++
This is a C++ code that simulates a bank system. It allows you to add an unlimited number of clients, sort the array of linked list by list size using the quick sort algorithm, and sort each index by their IDs. You can also make transactions and delete them, with a maximum of 5 transactions per client. Additionally, you cannot create two clients with the same email address. The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it easy to navigate and use. The use of linked lists allows for efficient data storage and manipulation, while the quick sort algorithm ensures fast and efficient sorting of the clients' information. Overall, this code provides a comprehensive and functional bank system simulation, allowing you to manage client information, transactions and perform various sorting operations.
